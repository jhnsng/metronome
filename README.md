# metronome
LCD display, potentiometer-controlled Arduino metronome

This is my code for a personal project. I have created a metronome using an Arduino Uno kit that displays the BPM (beats per minute) on a LCD screen, which can be adjusted using a potentiometer. Connected to the breadboard is a Piezo buzzer which beeps on tempo, as well as an LED light that blinks on tempo.

Next steps for this project:

- Add different time signature modes (4/4, 3/4, 6/8..etc)
